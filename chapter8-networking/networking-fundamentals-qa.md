# Chapter 8: Networking Fundamentals Q&A

## Purpose & Core Concepts

**Why does networking exist?**
To enable communication between systems, sharing resources, and accessing services across different machines and networks.

**What problem does networking solve?**
Allows isolated systems to communicate, share data, and provide distributed services without being physically connected.

## Network Management in RHEL 9

### Q: What manages networking in RHEL 9?
**A:** NetworkManager service - a dynamic, policy-based network configuration daemon.

**WHY:** Provides automatic network management, handles configuration changes, and maintains connectivity without manual intervention.

**Components:**
- Core service: `systemctl status NetworkManager`
- CLI tool: `nmcli`
- Text UI: `nmtui`
- Config: `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`

**Real-world Impact:** Eliminates manual network reconfiguration during system moves, supports modern patterns like containers and cloud deployments.

### Q: What if NetworkManager isn't installed?
**A:** System uses legacy network configuration methods:
- Direct kernel interface configuration
- DHCP client for automatic IP assignment
- Manual static configuration
- Cloud-init for initial setup

**WHY:** Minimal/container environments exclude NetworkManager to reduce overhead.

## Private Networks & NAT

### Q: How do private IP addresses reach the internet?
**A:** Through NAT (Network Address Translation) devices that translate private IPs to public IPs.

**WHY:** Limited public IPv4 addresses require sharing - private networks use RFC 1918 addresses internally.

### Q: What's the role of a router in NAT?
**A:** The router IS the NAT device in most cases.

**Router Functions:**
- **Routing:** Forwards packets between networks
- **NAT:** Translates private IPs to public IP
- **Gateway:** Default route for private network traffic

**Cloud vs Traditional:**
- **Traditional:** Router combines NAT + routing + switching + WiFi
- **Cloud:** Separated services (NAT Gateway, Route Tables, Internet Gateway)

**Real-world Impact:** Cloud architecture allows scaling NAT independently of routing - impossible with monolithic router appliances.

## Port Binding & Services

### Q: Can two servers run on the same port?
**A:** No - only one process can bind to a specific port on a given IP address.

**WHY:** OS prevents port conflicts to avoid ambiguous service endpoints.

**Workarounds:**
- Different IP addresses
- Load balancer/reverse proxy
- Different protocols (TCP vs UDP on same port)

### Q: Can TCP and UDP servers use the same port?
**A:** Yes - TCP and UDP are separate protocols with different socket types.

**Examples:**
- DNS: UDP:53 (queries) + TCP:53 (zone transfers)
- Minecraft: TCP:25565 (game) + UDP:25565 (ping)

**Real-world Impact:** Many services use both protocols on same port for different functions.

## Network Interfaces

### Q: What is a network interface?
**A:** Virtual connection point between host and network.

**Types:**
- **Physical:** NIC (Network Interface Card)
- **Virtual:** Software-defined (ENI, bridges, VLANs)
- **Logical:** eth0, wlan0, lo

### Q: What is an ENI in AWS?
**A:** Elastic Network Interface - virtualized network interface with persistent identity.

**Components:**
- IP address (private, optional public)
- MAC address (survives instance changes)
- Security groups (firewall rules)
- Subnet assignment
- DNS hostname

**WHY:** Allows network identity to survive instance changes, enables quick failover.

### Q: Why are interfaces named eth0, eth1?
**A:** Historical convention from early Unix/Linux systems.

**Evolution:**
- **Legacy:** eth0, eth1, eth2
- **Modern:** Predictable names (ens5, enp0s3)
- **Cloud:** Often still eth0 for simplicity

**Real-world Impact:** Cloud providers maintain familiar naming for user convenience.

## DHCP & Address Assignment

### Q: What is DHCP's purpose?
**A:** Automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration to devices.

**DHCP Process (DORA):**
1. **Discover** - Client broadcasts "I need an IP"
2. **Offer** - Server responds "Here's available IP"
3. **Request** - Client accepts the IP
4. **Acknowledge** - Server confirms assignment

**What DHCP Provides:**
- IP address from available pool
- Subnet mask
- Default gateway
- DNS servers
- Lease duration

**Real-world Impact:** Enables plug-and-play networking - devices automatically get network configuration.

### Q: How does AWS set default gateway via DHCP?
**A:** AWS VPC DHCP automatically assigns gateway as subnet's first IP + 1.

**AWS Logic:**
```
Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
Reserved:
- 10.0.1.0 (network)
- 10.0.1.1 (VPC router - your gateway)
- 10.0.1.2 (DNS resolver)
- 10.0.1.3 (reserved)
- 10.0.1.255 (broadcast)
```

## Default Gateway & Routing

### Q: What is a default gateway?
**A:** The "exit door" for traffic leaving your local network.

**Purpose:** When destination IP is not on local subnet, send packet to default gateway.

**Decision Process:**
1. Check if destination is local subnet
2. If local - send directly via ARP
3. If remote - send to default gateway
4. Gateway forwards toward destination

### Q: How to identify my default gateway?
**A:** Use routing commands:
```bash
ip route show default
route -n | grep "^0.0.0.0"
```

**Format:** Typically first usable IP in subnet:
- Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24 → Gateway: 192.168.1.1
- Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24 → Gateway: 10.0.1.1

### Q: Decode this routing table:
```
default via 172.16.0.1 dev eth0
172.16.0.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.16.0.2
```

**A:**
- **Line 1:** All non-local traffic → send to 172.16.0.1 via eth0
- **Line 2:** Local subnet traffic (172.16.0.x) → direct delivery via eth0

**Field Meanings:**
- `dev eth0` = use network interface eth0
- `proto kernel` = route added automatically by kernel
- `scope link` = directly reachable (no router needed)
- `src 172.16.0.2` = source IP for outgoing packets

**Real-world Impact:** Kernel checks specific routes first, falls back to default for unmatched destinations.

## Interface Types & Tools

### Q: Difference between Ethernet, WLAN, and WAN interfaces?
**A:**
- **Ethernet:** Wired connection via cable
- **WLAN:** Wireless connection via radio
- **WAN:** Wide area network connection

**Cloud Engineer Perspective:** Mostly abstracted away - you get virtual interfaces regardless of underlying physical medium.

### Q: Difference between `ip` and `ifconfig` utilities?
**A:**
- **ifconfig:** Legacy BSD tool (1980s) - basic interface management
- **ip:** Modern Linux tool from iproute2 - comprehensive networking

**Advantages of `ip`:**
- Active development with new features
- Container/namespace support
- JSON output for scripting
- More protocols (IPv6, MPLS)

**Real-world Impact:** Modern automation tools and containers use `ip` commands exclusively.

## Localhost & Loopback

### Q: What is localhost and 127.0.0.1?
**A:** `localhost` is DNS name that resolves to `127.0.0.1` (loopback interface).

**Purpose:** Internal communication within same host - processes talking to each other.

**Universal Presence:** Every Linux system has loopback interface by default.

**Uses:**
- Database connections to localhost
- Microservice communication
- System monitoring
- Network testing

**Real-world Impact:** Always available for local services and debugging - as fundamental as having a filesystem.

## Gateway vs Router vs NAT

### Q: What's the confusion between default gateway, router, and NAT device?
**A:** They can be the same physical device, causing terminology confusion.

**Traditional Networks:** One box does multiple functions:
- Routing (forwards packets)
- NAT (translates IPs)
- Gateway (exit point)

**Cloud Networks:** Separated services:
- Default Gateway: VPC router (routes packets)
- Internet Gateway: Provides internet access
- NAT Gateway: Handles IP translation

**Key Distinction:**
- **Default Gateway:** Where to send non-local traffic (routing decision)
- **Router:** Device that forwards packets between networks
- **NAT Device:** Translates IP addresses

**Real-world Impact:** Cloud separation enables independent scaling and better reliability than monolithic appliances.

## Socket Statistics & Monitoring

### Q: Difference between `ss` and `netstat` utilities?
**A:**
- **netstat:** Legacy BSD tool (1980s) - slow, reads `/proc/net/*` files
- **ss:** Modern replacement from iproute2 - fast, queries kernel via netlink

**Performance Difference:**
- **netstat:** Slow on busy systems with many connections
- **ss:** Fast execution, especially with thousands of connections

**Real-world Impact:** On high-traffic servers, `ss` completes in seconds while `netstat` may take minutes.

### Q: What does `ss` stand for and when to use it?
**A:** **Socket Statistics** - displays detailed network socket information.

**When to use ss:**
- Check which services are listening on ports
- Troubleshoot network connectivity issues  
- Monitor active connections
- Identify processes using specific ports
- Security audits for unexpected services

### Q: Why don't I see process names in `ss -tulnp`?
**A:** Need **root privileges** to see process information for all sockets.

**Without sudo:** Empty Process column
**With sudo:** Shows process names, PIDs, file descriptors

**Example:**
```bash
# Regular user - no process info
ss -tulnp

# Root user - shows process details
sudo ss -tulnp
```

### Q: What's the difference between Local Address and Peer Address?
**A:**
- **Local Address:** Your server's IP and port (where service is listening)
- **Peer Address:** Remote client's IP and port (who's connecting)

**Examples:**
- **LISTEN state:** Local=`0.0.0.0:80`, Peer=`0.0.0.0:*` (accepting any connection)
- **ESTABLISHED:** Local=`127.0.0.1:80`, Peer=`127.0.0.1:54321` (specific connection)

**Analogy:** Like a phone call - Local Address is your number, Peer Address is who's calling.

### Q: What do Recv-Q and Send-Q mean in `ss` output?
**A:** Queue sizes showing data flow status:

**For LISTEN sockets:**
- **Recv-Q:** Usually 0 (no pending data)
- **Send-Q:** **Backlog queue size** (max pending connections)

**For ESTABLISHED sockets:**
- **Recv-Q:** Incoming data waiting to be read
- **Send-Q:** Outgoing data waiting to be sent

**Critical Point:** High Recv-Q values indicate application can't process data fast enough (performance bottleneck).

## SS Command Cheatsheet

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Show all connections
ss

# Show TCP connections only
ss -t

# Show UDP connections only  
ss -u

# Show listening sockets only
ss -l

# Show all (listening + established)
ss -a
```

### Combined Options
```bash
# Most useful combinations
ss -tlnp    # TCP listening with process info
ss -ulnp    # UDP listening with process info  
ss -tulnp   # All listening sockets with processes
ss -tnp     # All TCP connections with processes

# Add 'sudo' to see all process details
sudo ss -tulnp
```

### Filtering & Advanced Usage
```bash
# Show statistics summary
ss -s

# IPv4 only
ss -4

# IPv6 only  
ss -6

# Filter by port (SSH example)
ss -lnt sport = :22

# Filter by state
ss state established
ss state listening

# Combine with grep
ss -tulnp | grep :80
```

### Socket States
Common states you'll see:
- **LISTEN** - Waiting for incoming connections
- **ESTABLISHED** - Active connection
- **TIME_WAIT** - Connection closed, cleanup pending
- **CLOSE_WAIT** - Remote closed, local still open
- **SYN_SENT** - Attempting to connect

### Interpreting Output
```bash
# Example output explanation
State  Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port Peer Address:Port Process
LISTEN 0      511    0.0.0.0:80        0.0.0.0:*         nginx
```

**Breakdown:**
- **State:** LISTEN (waiting for connections)
- **Recv-Q:** 0 (no pending data)
- **Send-Q:** 511 (backlog queue size - can handle 511 pending connections)
- **Local:** 0.0.0.0:80 (nginx listening on all interfaces, port 80)
- **Peer:** 0.0.0.0:* (accepting from any IP/port)
- **Process:** nginx (service name)

**Real-world Usage:** Use `sudo ss -tulnp` for comprehensive socket monitoring and troubleshooting network services.
